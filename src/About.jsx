      <p>
        Elio Labs is a curated space dedicated to deep learning exploration and
        experimentation. Each notebook focuses on a specific concept or
        technique in modern ML—from core intuition to hands-on implementation,
        optimization strategies, and practical workflows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This platform documents learning, shares structured research progress,
        and makes advanced topics easier to digest step-by-step with clarity,
        visual intuition, and clean code. New notebooks are added as research
        grows.
